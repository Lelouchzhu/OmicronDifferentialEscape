# OmicronDifferentialEscape

Repository for the code and raw data for the antigenic cartography (Extend Fig 4) for Evidence for emergence of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variants under immune selection.

Antigenic map was generated using the R package “Racmacs” (version 1.1.18) in R (version 4.1.2) based on the matrix of neutralization titer 50% of serum on the 20 sarbecoviruses on multiplex sVNT.The number of optimizations was set to 1000.
